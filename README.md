## Yellow Pages
This is a simple CRUD created using Python. The idea is inspired by the Yellow Pages physical phone book, which contains contacts of businesses and public places of interest in an area.
The following are the included features (based on the CRUD framework):
1. Show Categories and Contacts along with its details, alongside a feature to show only Bookmarked Contacts.
2. Add New Categories and Contacts
3. Delete Existing Contacts
4. Edit Existing Contacts and Category Names.
